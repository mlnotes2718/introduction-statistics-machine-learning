    "Let’s begin with a question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Imagine you’re analyzing people’s daily commute times.\n",
    "Some take 5 minutes, some 20, some 60 — the numbers vary.\n",
    "Why might it be useful to model this data with a “distribution”?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it — what could a distribution tell you that a single average (like “the mean commute is 30 minutes”) cannot?"

    "Let’s build on that idea:\n",
    "- If you only know the mean, you know the center.\n",
    "- If you also know the distribution, you know how the data are shaped —\n",
    "e.g. are most commutes short, or are there a few very long ones?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple way to say it:\n",
