    "1. Symmetry vs. Skewness\n",
    "- Symmetric distribution: left = right (like the normal distribution). Mean ≈ Median.\n",
    "- Right-skewed (positive skew): long tail on the right. Mean > Median.\n",

    "- Describes how “peaked” or “flat” a distribution is compared to normal.\n",
    "- Leptokurtic: sharp peak, heavy tails.\n",
    "- Platykurtic: flat, light tails.\n",
    "- Mesokurtic: normal-like.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why Shape Matters\n",
    "- Shape affects which measure of center and spread is most appropriate.\n",
