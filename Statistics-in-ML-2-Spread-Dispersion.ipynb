    "\n",
    "Two datasets can have the same mean but look very different:\n",
    "- Dataset A: 10, 10, 10, 10, 10 (mean = 10, no spread)\n",

    "    a) Range\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Formula: max – min\n",
    "        - Example: In B above → 15 – 5 = 10\n",
    "        - Very sensitive to outliers (if one number jumps to 100, range = 95).\n",

    "    b) Variance & Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Variance = average squared distance from the mean.\n",
    "        - Standard deviation = square root of variance (brings units back to original).\n",
    "        - They use all data points, so they’re more “stable” than range but still affected by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c) Interquartile Range (IQR)\n",
    "\n",
    "        - IQR = Q3 – Q1 (spread of the middle 50% of data).\n",
    "        - Less sensitive to outliers, because it ignores the lowest 25% and highest 25%.\n",
    "        - Often used in boxplots and to define outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Outliers and Their Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "- Range: explodes if even one extreme value appears.\n",
    "- Variance & SD: pulled upward, because squaring exaggerates large deviations.\n",
    "- IQR: relatively unaffected — it only cares about the middle 50%."
